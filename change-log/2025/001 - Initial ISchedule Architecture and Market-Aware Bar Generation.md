## Erratum — 2026-07-16

This entry is appended, not rewritten. It is factually false in five places, and the record of
being wrong is preserved rather than edited away — see `AlphaHawk` repo,
`- Progress Reports/PR009-2026-07-15-Resurrection-Assessment.md` §13, and
`docs/sprints/SPRINT-02.md` for the fuller history.

| Line | Claim | Measured reality |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | `**Status:** ✅ Complete` | The generator did not implement the model it was named for. |
| 9, 89, 209 | "mathematical rigor through Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) modeling" / "proper log-normal distribution" | The generator's random term was three fixed-frequency sine waves, bounded and non-cumulative — a stationary series, not a random walk. Setting `volatility: 0` changed nothing; the variance ratio decayed as ~1/k instead of holding near 1; lag-1 autocorrelation measured **-0.50**, the textbook signature of differenced i.i.d. noise. |
| 42 | "53 Tests Total... 100% pass rate" | True as stated, but every assertion was structural (`High >= Open`, `Volume > 0`, determinism) — not one was distributional. All 53 passed for a generator that failed every statistical property of the model it claimed to implement. |
| 121 | "zero errors or warnings" | Not a code defect — the build was clean. The claim is listed here because it sat alongside the mathematical claims under one "Quality Metrics" heading, lending them unearned credibility. |

**What actually shipped 2026-07-16:** `GbmBarSeries.Generator` was rewritten around a hash-seeded
Brownian bridge — deterministic, O(log elapsed time), true random-walk statistics. A statistical
battery (variance ratio at k=2,4,8,16,32, lag-1 autocorrelation, both against Lo-MacKinlay/Bartlett
tolerances fixed before the generator existed, plus bar-to-bar continuity and volatility
parameter-liveness) was added specifically because the 53 tests above could not have caught this
and, unchanged, still could not. The type name `GbmBarSeries` remains **inaccurate** — a Brownian
bridge is not GBM — and the rename is deferred: it breaks a live consumer in the parent AlphaHawk
repo that this submodule's own build cannot see, so renaming here without coordinating there would
silently reintroduce the class of defect this erratum exists to document.
